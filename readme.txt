This is the VeraDemo application - Blab
It is a fairly simple forum type application which allows:
 - users to post a message (blab)
 - users to follow the messages of other users or not (listen or ignore)
 - users to comment on other users messages (blabs)
 
 There is a url (verademo/reset) which will reset the data in the database with a load of
  - users
  - blabs
  - commments
  
 The main url (verademo/feed) shows the messages that are relevant to the current user
